# Section05-Campaign Simulation

## Section Objectives
This section's goal is to practice the concepts that will be essential for PA6. 

Specifically, the main given will use a collection of politicians, which will be fleshed out by you. Similar to the upcoming project, this section will require the use of polymorphism, specifically in terms of overloading, overriding, and utilizing super classes. 

Before getting started, consider the idea of encapsulating different politicians from different parties, and how this could be implemented in the code. Look through the main at how the implementation is currently working, and draw a class diagram. More information about class diagrams can be found at the following link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_hierarchy

## Political Campaign Simulation
Imagine it is 2020 already... You're farther ahead in school, and things are changing. Specifically, it's time for the next round of Presidential elections! 

With all of the news of more candidates stepping up to run their campaign, we will be modeling this election process in terms of the Republican, Democratic, and Libertarian parties, where polymorphism will be used to encapsulate different attributes of the different candidates and their party association. 

The way the main works, based on the information stored inside of each candidate, all the parties will choose their respective candidate through a "debate" process, before running the process of a "mock election," where each state, based on a candidates political standing, will award votes to whichever candidate aligns the most with their values. By the end of the simulation, the winner of the election will be announced to standard input. 

Although you will not be implementing this described process, you will need to look over the code to understand what is missing, and what is necessary inside of the classes you will be writing. In order for this to be successful, your implementation of these methods will require polymorphism, as well as overloading, overriding, and use of the super class.
